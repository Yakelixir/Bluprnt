Vision: https://bluprnt.org/the-tale-of-an-idea-city/

A Community built on Virtuous Spontaneity
We are building self sustaining communication and learning protocols to facilitate desperately needed global innovation

We are an innovation network where people can build, invest in, and grow ideas just by helping others grow. The platform facilitates paying it forward to make lives better through innovation.

# Philosphy
Anything is Possible
A Blessing and a Curse 
Since you are alot like us, you can’t help but see the questions that need to be better understood. The type of questions that keep you up at night wondering why things are the way they are.

It’s a blessing to see them and a curse that we can’t let them without making it better. We live for these questions, their possibilities, and where they’ll lead us. 

What do you want to create for yourself?
Are you unable to ignore the beautiful questions?

We’ve learned, you don’t have to do it alone and working together will make “it” better. It’s an honor to serve with such great people in our innovative cooperative. Their joy, confidence, and support has made all of this possible. 

# Initial Question
Why do people not have enough lifetime to build their ideas?

We choose the name Bluprnt because, 
as Martin Luther King Jr. said, 
“we all must find the blueprint of our life”. 
So, we took out all the vowels except “u”, 
because it doesn’t work without you.  

Dr. Seuss in the Lorax said, 
“Unless someone like you, 
Cares a whole awful lot, 
Nothing is going to get better, 
It’s not.”

So, we say,
“Let’s make it better, 
Whatever that is,
Let’s fill a few holes in the road, 
Help humanity progress, and
Leave a long lasting legacy.”

Hence, an ideal became,
through belief, joy, and fun, 
A community of innovators, 
The resources to build ideas, and
Trust and Security to better Collaboration.

The depth of this question prompted our creation and continues to drive innovation within the protocol and community. 

In various capacities, starting in garages and basements then more officially, in startups, then working with investment groups, and leading to our current role as a relentless connector, we have acquired experience in all phases of launching healthy companies. Its been a wild ride, including finding brilliant people, building world class teams, and metric ton of rapid prototyping.

Its been an amazing journey over fifteen years of leading companies to growth and revenue, doing this research with founders and investment groups, and growing the concept into a community over the last two years.

# Statement of Values

We are people of integrity that have an honest conversation with ourselves,
the wide beautiful world, and those around us. We collaborate transparently through a sense of extreme ownership to empower people to innovate.

Tangible and Effective values we take to the table of collaboration…
Fun&nbsp;
Some of the greatest challenges to innovation are disinterest and apathy.

Objective:&nbsp;
A truly objective space where the mission to make the world better is the gaurd rails for personal opinions.

Ethical:&nbsp;
This is something that everyone needs to be aware of when they build.

Feasible:&nbsp;
Build it or not however the balance of pain and elegance is always to be considered. 

Community driven:&nbsp;
A community that challenges and inspires you is invaluable. We believe the community will built “it”.

Doesn’t discriminate:&nbsp;
Your age, country, and gender don’t determine what you are capable of learning.

Allows for failure:&nbsp;
Failure is one of the best paths to sucess. The best learners allow themselves to make many mistakes along their journey.

Sparks questions:&nbsp;
The cultivation and culmination of great ideas isn’t knowing all the answers — it’s knowing how to listen to the world.
